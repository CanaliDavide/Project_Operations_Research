# Project_Operations_Research - FOR 2021/2022 PoliMi

The company RoboMarkt specializes in installing and servicing automatic grocery stores that sell goods in remote areas of a sparse country, where traditional stores are anti-economical. These automatic stores (“stores” from now on) sell food and beverages as well as house goods such as toiletries and books.
The company wants to know where it should install these stores and with what routes every truck should serve them so that the costs (building plus refurbishing costs) are minimized.

Our solution to the problem is structured into two parts: 
1. The first part aims at choosing which cities will become markets. More specifically it identifies 80 
possible solutions: 40 trying to minimize the cost of building the markets and 40 trying to minimize 
the number of markets. 
2. The second part aims at finding the optimal route for each solution computed in the first part, to 
refurbish all markets using different number of trucks.
